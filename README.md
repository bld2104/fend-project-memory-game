## Instructions

Click on squares to reveal their icon. Try to match icons. Once you match all icons you win the game! The timer will track how long it takes you to complete. If it takes you less than 10 moves, you get a 3 star rating. If it takes you between 10 and 15 moves, you get a 2 star rating. If it takes you more than 15 moves, you receive a 1-star rating. Use the refresh button to restart the game if you so desire.

You should be able to download this zip file or clone it and then simply open the index.html file in any browser to get the game working.
